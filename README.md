# Unit Testing with Jest

This repository demonstrates how to perform unit testing using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework. Unit testing is essential for ensuring the correctness of individual components and functions in your codebase. Jest provides an easy-to-use and powerful platform for writing and executing unit tests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) should be installed on your machine. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**
git clone https://github.com/Mhmdyasser33/unit-test-with-jest

2. **Install the project dependencies:**
npm install


## Writing Unit Tests

All unit tests are located in the `__tests__` directory. You can organize your tests by creating files named like `filename.test.js` or `filename.spec.js` inside this directory.

Here's an example of a simple unit test for a `utils.js` module:

```javascript
// __tests__/utils.test.js

const utils = require('../utils');

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(utils.add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});

test('checks if value is greater than 10', () => {
  expect(utils.isGreaterThan10(15)).toBe(true);
  expect(utils.isGreaterThan10(8)).toBe(false);
});

## Running Tests
Run the tests using the following command:
npm test
Jest will discover and execute all test files in the __tests__ directory and provide you with the test results.

Configuration
Jest configuration options can be found in the jest.config.js file. You can customize settings such as test environment, test match patterns, and more in this file.

Continuous Integration
You can integrate this project with continuous integration (CI) services like Travis CI, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI to automatically run tests on every push or pull request.
