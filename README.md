# Unit Testing with Jest

This repository demonstrates how to perform unit testing using **Jest**, a popular JavaScript testing framework. Unit testing is essential for ensuring the correctness of individual components and functions in your codebase. Jest provides an easy-to-use and powerful platform for writing and executing unit tests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm:** Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mhmdyasser33/unit-test-with-jest

## Install the project dependencies: 
npm install 

## Writing Unit Tests
All unit tests are located in the __tests__ directory. You can organize your tests by creating files named like filename.test.js or filename.spec.js inside this directory.

Here's an example of a simple unit test for a utils.js module:**
      ```bash
      // __tests__/utils.test.js
      
      const utils = require('../utils');
      
      test('Adding 1 + 2 should equal 3', () => {
        expect(utils.add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
      });
      
      test('Checking if a value is greater than 10', () => {
        expect(utils.isGreaterThan10(15)).toBe(true);
        expect(utils.isGreaterThan10(8)).toBe(false);
      });
  ## Running Tests
 Run the tests using the following command:**
      ```bash
         npm test
Jest will discover and execute all test files in the __tests__ directory and provide you with the test results.

 ## Configuration
Jest configuration options can be found in the jest.config.js file. You can customize settings such as test environment, test match patterns, and more in this file.

 ## Continuous Integration
You can integrate this project with continuous integration (CI) services like Travis CI, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI to automatically run tests on every push or pull request.
